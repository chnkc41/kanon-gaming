# Welcome to Kanon Gaming Test Project

## Start the project 

### `npm i`
### `npm run start`

Start the user server for Sign-up - Json Server
### `npm run server-user`

Start the user server for Sign-in - Json server + JWT Token

Go to api folder. 
### `cd api`
### `npm i`
### `npm run start-auth`

Might need to run
### `npm audit fix`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.



## NOTE: 

After creating a new user the "Json server + JWT Token" step should be run again.

I use the json server from [this repo.](https://github.com/techiediaries/fake-api-jwt-json-server) to view it in your browser.



## What did I use?

[Tailwindcss & React.js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)
[Json Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com)
[React-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction)
...
Check the packaga.json file for others.
## Generel Note:
I used "https://restcountries.com/" API as there is no "https://restcountries.eu/" API.

For the second question, since there is no support for multiple requests, I filtered the code area. I can provide that in case there is an API with support.

After logging in in question 4, I updated the e-mail address at the top right on the redux side. I've updated it with the active e-mail address for example.

I did not write the backend service requested in question 6, but I showed all the necessary information on the frontend.
